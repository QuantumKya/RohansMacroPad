# RohansMacroPad

## What it is
I wanted to follow the tutorial on [hackpad.hackclub.com](hackpad.hackclub.com) accurately and make a macropad with 4 buttons, a XIAO thingy, and two LEDs.

## What it does
Gives me one point on Highway per extra key I will now have to press and make my computer do things.

## What it looks like

## How I made it
I followed the tutorial on Hackclub's website! It was vague at times, but it was very good at teaching me the basics of everything!
